# Betical

A born-digital paragraph generator composed with remixed typed assemblage-letters.

## About

Quote from [Screening(s)](http://screencanadianelit.ca/betical/):

> “Betical” is a born-digital paragraph generator; concept and art by Dani Spinosa, programming by Jon Orsi.
>
> Inspired by Nick Montfort’s “Taroko Gorge,” and other early poetry generators and bots, “Betical” recreates a brand new, randomly generated paragraph each time it is loaded. The images that constitute the letters and form the words are assemblage-letters produced by remixing a scan of the letters typed from Spinosa’s own typewriter, an Olympia SM9.
